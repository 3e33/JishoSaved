# JishoSaved
A quick and dirty Waterfox / Firefox addon (WebExtension) that adds ability to save and load definitions in Jisho.org.

### Wishlist for future development
* delete individual definitions
* import / export
* clicking button would search for images related to word and show thumbnails in the definition (not saved)
